# /code-review -- MCP-Powered Code Review

## What

Performs a comprehensive, multi-dimensional code review that combines Roslyn MCP
tool analysis with structured manual review. Every review follows a consistent
7-step process and produces findings categorized by severity (Critical, Warning,
Suggestion) with actionable remediation guidance.

Review dimensions:
- **Correctness** -- Logic errors, edge cases, null handling, async pitfalls
- **Security** -- Auth gaps, injection risks, secret exposure, CORS issues
- **Performance** -- N+1 queries, missing indexes, unnecessary allocations, missing cancellation
- **Architecture** -- Layer violations, coupling issues, boundary breaches
- **Maintainability** -- Naming, complexity, duplication, test coverage
- **API Design** -- HTTP semantics, error responses, versioning, OpenAPI metadata

## When

- "Review this code", "PR review", "code review"
- Before merging a pull request
- After a major refactor to verify no regressions or design drift
- When onboarding to unfamiliar code and wanting a quality assessment
- Periodic health checks on critical modules

## How

### Step 1: Scope the Review

Determine what is being reviewed:
- **PR review**: Use `git diff main...HEAD` to identify all changed files
- **File review**: Focus on specified files
- **Module review**: Identify all files in the module/feature

Categorize changed files by layer (domain, application, infrastructure, API, tests).

### Step 2: MCP Diagnostics Scan

Run Roslyn MCP tools on the review scope:

```
get_diagnostics(scope: "project", path: "affected-project")
```

- Flag new warnings and errors
- Group by severity and category
- Identify nullable reference warnings -- these often indicate missing null checks

### Step 3: Antipattern Detection

```
detect_antipatterns(projectFilter: "affected-project")
```

- Review each finding against the change context
- Distinguish pre-existing antipatterns from newly introduced ones
- Focus review effort on new antipatterns

### Step 4: Blast Radius Analysis

For each significant change, measure its impact:

```
find_references(symbolName: "ModifiedType")
find_callers(methodName: "ModifiedMethod")
get_dependency_graph(symbolName: "ModifiedMethod", depth: 2)
```

- Identify all consumers of modified APIs
- Check if callers handle new error cases or changed return types
- Flag changes with high blast radius for extra scrutiny

### Step 5: Architecture Compliance

Verify changes respect architectural boundaries:

```
get_type_hierarchy(typeName: "NewOrModifiedType")
find_implementations(interfaceName: "AffectedInterface")
```

- Domain types must not reference infrastructure
- Application layer must not bypass domain logic
- New dependencies should follow existing dependency direction
- Cross-module communication must go through defined contracts

### Step 6: Manual Review

Review aspects that tools cannot catch:
- **Business logic correctness** -- Does the code do what it is supposed to?
- **Edge cases** -- What happens with empty collections, null inputs, concurrent access?
- **Error messages** -- Are they actionable for the end user?
- **Naming clarity** -- Do names communicate intent?
- **Test quality** -- Do tests verify behavior or just exercise code paths?

### Step 7: Produce the Review

Output a structured review with this format:

```markdown
## Code Review: [Scope Description]

### Summary
[1-3 sentence overview of the change and overall assessment]

### Critical (must fix before merge)
- **[Finding title]** -- [file:line]
  [What is wrong, why it matters, how to fix]

### Warnings (should fix, creates tech debt)
- **[Finding title]** -- [file:line]
  [What is wrong, why it matters, how to fix]

### Suggestions (nice to have)
- **[Finding title]** -- [file:line]
  [Recommendation and rationale]

### Architecture Compliance
[PASS/WARN with notes on boundary violations]

### Test Coverage
[Assessment of test coverage for the changes]

### What's Good
- [Positive observations -- always include this section]
```

## Example

```
User: /code-review the changes in this PR

Claude: Scoping review to 7 changed files across 3 projects...

## Code Review: Order Processing Feature

### Summary
Adds CreateOrder and GetOrder endpoints with EF Core persistence.
Well-structured VSA feature with good test coverage. Two issues
need attention before merge.

### Critical
- **Missing CancellationToken propagation** -- CreateOrder.cs:38
  The handler calls DbContext.SaveChangesAsync() without passing
  the CancellationToken. If the client disconnects, the server
  continues processing. Pass `ct` from the handler parameter.

### Warnings
- **N+1 query in GetOrder** -- GetOrder.cs:25
  Loading Order without .Include(o => o.Items) causes a lazy-load
  per item during serialization. Add eager loading or use a projection.

### Suggestions
- **Consider sealed class** -- CreateOrderHandler.cs:10
  Handler classes are not inherited. Mark as sealed for minor
  performance benefit and clearer intent.

### Architecture Compliance
PASS -- All changes within Features/Orders/, no layer violations.

### Test Coverage
Two integration tests cover the happy path. Consider adding tests
for validation failures and not-found scenarios.

### What's Good
- Clean separation of command and query features
- FluentValidation rules cover all edge cases
- Response DTOs use records with good property names
```
